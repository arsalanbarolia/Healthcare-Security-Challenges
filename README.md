## Abstract

<p align="justify">

Body area network (BAN) are commonly used in healthcare environments such as hospitals, surgical centers, clinics, etc. to aid in the monitoring for chronic diseases like asthma and heart attacks. BAN enables sensors and actuators to connect to the human body and collect the patients’ readings which can then be viewed by the physician. Wireless body area network (WBAN) offers more flexibility in terms of transferring the patient’s recordings as it uses a greater range of communication methods that BAN is not capable of. Like any biomedical instrumentation, BAN is essential for healthcare monitoring, healthcare systems, sport medics, and multimedia communication. However, since these networks are small and they utilize sensors and actuators, high levels of energy are consumed to ensure that no data loss occurs during the transmitting of information. In this comprehensive survey, the methodological approaches of BAN regarding the safety, reliability, effectiveness of transmitting data, and security will be thoroughly discussed.
